# BoxShooter
This is the repo for my Box Shooter game, built in Unity 5. This game was built as a final project for the course "Introduction to Game Development" at Michigan State University through Coursera. You can download builds for the game for Mac, Windows, and Linux in the Builds folder, or download the whole project to see the Unity work behind the scenes. Use WASD or the arrow keys to move and click to shoot!

## Notable Features and Challenges
* User Interface (reticle, score, timer, rotating menu)
* Projectile implementation
* Target variety and movement
* Target random spawning
* Game Manager for win, game over, level switching

I really hope you enjoy!
